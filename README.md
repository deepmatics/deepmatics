## Hi, I am Satish! 👋

### 🤖 Architect | Engineering the Next Wave of Autonomous AI Agents & LLMs

I specialize in the core engineering required to build and scale **autonomous AI agents**. My focus is on transforming cutting-edge research into stable, testable, and reusable open-source solutions. I believe in contributing clear patterns, robust code, and tested setups back to the community.

### 🧠 My Core Engineering Focus

My hands-on work revolves around the entire lifecycle of LLM and Agent applications:

| Area | Technical Focus & Contributions |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Autonomous Agents** | Engineering single and **Multi-Agent Systems** (MAS) with robust **Tool Calling**, advanced **Planning**, **Memory Management**, and **Agent Orchestration** (e.g., using CrewAI, LangGraph). |
| **RAG & Search** | Building high-leverage retrieval systems: from basic vector chains to **Agentic RAG**, **Hybrid Search**, and efficient local RAG implementations. |
| **LLM Optimization** | Techniques like LoRA/QLoRA for **Fine-Tuning** (Gemma, Llama, and other OSS models), **Domain Adaptation**, and **Inference Optimization** for scalable deployment. |
| **MLOps for Agents** | Structuring developer workflows, implementing robust logging, **evaluation (`Ragas`, `TruLens`)**, and planning structures for complex multi-step tasks. |
